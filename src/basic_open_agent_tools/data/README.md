# Data Tools Status

## Overview
Data structure utilities, validation, and serialization tools for AI agents.

## Current Status
All planned data modules have been implemented and tested:
- ✅ Basic data structures and operations
- ✅ JSON and CSV processing
- ✅ Data validation and schema checking
- ✅ Data transformation and cleaning
- ✅ Object serialization and deserialization
- ✅ Configuration file processing (YAML, TOML, INI)
- ✅ Binary data handling and encoding
- ✅ Archive file creation and extraction

## Design Considerations for Agent Tools
- Memory efficiency for large datasets
- Functions designed as individual agent tools
- Type safety and validation
- Immutable data operations where possible
- Clear error messages and handling
- Performance considerations for bulk operations
- Security awareness for deserialization (especially pickle)
- Consistent API design across modules
- Functions suitable for agent framework integration
- Clear function signatures optimized for AI tool usage
- Avoid complex querying features (delegate to MCP servers)
- Focus on local data manipulation and validation
- Size limits to prevent memory exhaustion attacks
- Input sanitization for all transformation functions
- **Exclude visualization tools** (charts/graphs belong in separate visualization module)
- **Exclude Excel/spreadsheet processing** (complex dependencies, better suited for specialized tools)
- Prioritize text-based formats over binary formats where possible
- Support streaming/chunked processing for large files
- Provide both synchronous and memory-efficient variants for bulk operations

## Excluded from Data Module (Separate Module Considerations)
- **XML Processing** - Complex parsing, XPath, schema validation (heavy dependencies, specialized use cases)
- **Visualization Tools** - Charts, graphs, plots (should be in dedicated `visualization` module)
- **Excel/Spreadsheet Processing** - Complex .xlsx/.xls handling (requires heavy dependencies)
- **Machine Learning Data Prep** - Feature engineering, model-specific preprocessing (separate `ml` module)
