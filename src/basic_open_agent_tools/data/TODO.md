# Data Tools TODO

## Current Status (v0.8.1)

### ✅ Completed (v0.8.1+)
- [x] **Google ADK Function Tool Compliance**: Full compatibility with Google ADK standards
- [x] **Enhanced Test Coverage**: Achieved 96%+ test coverage (255+ test cases)
- [x] **Quality Assurance**: 100% ruff + mypy compliance across all modules
- [x] **Agent Framework Integration**: Verified compatibility with Google ADK, LangChain, and custom agents
- [x] **Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure**: Dual testing strategy (traditional + agent evaluation)
- [x] **Type Safety**: JSON-serializable types only, no defaults, consistent exception patterns
- [x] **Production-Ready Module**: 30+ functions with comprehensive testing and documentation
- [x] **ADK Evaluation Framework**: Complete agent testing infrastructure with rate limiting

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] **Data Caching Tools** (`caching.py`)
  - Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data
  - Support for memory and disk-based caching
  - Cache invalidation strategies
  - Thread-safe caching operations

- [ ] **Streaming Data Processing** (`streaming.py`)
  - Support for processing large files in chunks
  - Memory-efficient iterators for large datasets
  - Stream transformation utilities
  - Progress tracking for long-running operations

- [ ] **Performance Optimizations**
  - Memory-efficient variants for bulk operations
  - Parallel processing options for data transformation
  - Benchmarking utilities for data operations

- [ ] **Advanced Validation Features**
  - Custom validation rule creation
  - Validation pipelines
  - Enhanced error reporting and visualization

## Maintenance Tasks

- [ ] Add comprehensive benchmarks for all data operations
- [ ] Enhance documentation with more examples
- [x] Add type hints for all return values (completed v0.6.0)
- [x] Simplify type signatures for agent compatibility (completed v0.6.0)
- [ ] Create more comprehensive test cases
- [ ] Add performance comparison between simple and complex variants

## Design Considerations for Future Development
- ✅ **Agent-First Design**: All functions use basic Python types (str, dict, list, bool)
- ✅ **No Complex Types**: Eliminated Union types, PathLike, and custom type aliases
- ✅ **Individual Import Support**: Functions designed for agent framework tool loading
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing API
- Prioritize memory efficiency for large dataset operations
- Keep dependencies minimal
- Ensure all new features align with agent-centric design principles

## Agent Framework Integration Notes

As of v0.8.1, all data functions are fully compliant with Google ADK standards:
- **Google ADK**: 100% Function Tool compliance with JSON-serializable types
- **LangChain**: Functions integrate seamlessly with StructuredTool
- **Custom Agents**: Broad compatibility with simple, consistent signatures
- **Testing**: Complete ADK evaluation framework validates agent compatibility
- **Example**: `read_csv_simple(file_path: str) -> List[Dict[str, str]]` with proper type annotations
