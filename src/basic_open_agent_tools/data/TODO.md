# Data Tools TODO

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] **Data Caching Tools** (`caching.py`)
  - Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data
  - Support for memory and disk-based caching
  - Cache invalidation strategies
  - Thread-safe caching operations

- [ ] **Streaming Data Processing** (`streaming.py`)
  - Support for processing large files in chunks
  - Memory-efficient iterators for large datasets
  - Stream transformation utilities
  - Progress tracking for long-running operations

- [ ] **Performance Optimizations**
  - Memory-efficient variants for bulk operations
  - Parallel processing options for data transformation
  - Benchmarking utilities for data operations

- [ ] **Advanced Validation Features**
  - Custom validation rule creation
  - Validation pipelines
  - Enhanced error reporting and visualization

## Maintenance Tasks

- [ ] Add comprehensive benchmarks for all data operations
- [ ] Enhance documentation with more examples
- [x] Add type hints for all return values
- [ ] Create more comprehensive test cases

## Design Considerations for Future Development
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing API
- Prioritize memory efficiency for large dataset operations
- Keep dependencies minimal
- Ensure all new features align with agent-centric design principles
