# PDF Module TODO

## Planned Enhancements

### High Priority

#### PDF Form Support
- [ ] Extract form field values
- [ ] Fill form fields programmatically
- [ ] Validate form data
- [ ] Export form data to JSON/dict

#### Image Extraction
- [ ] Extract embedded images from PDFs
- [ ] Get image metadata (size, format, position)
- [ ] Save images to files
- [ ] Convert pages to images

#### Encryption & Security
- [ ] Encrypt PDFs with passwords
- [ ] Decrypt password-protected PDFs
- [ ] Set permissions (print, copy, modify)
- [ ] Remove passwords from PDFs

### Medium Priority

#### Table Extraction
- [ ] Detect tables in PDFs
- [ ] Extract table data to structured format
- [ ] Convert tables to CSV/dict
- [ ] Handle multi-page tables

#### PDF to Image Conversion
- [ ] Convert PDF pages to PNG/JPEG
- [ ] Configurable DPI settings
- [ ] Batch conversion support
- [ ] Thumbnail generation

#### Bookmarks & Outlines
- [ ] Read PDF bookmarks/table of contents
- [ ] Add bookmarks to PDFs
- [ ] Modify existing bookmarks
- [ ] Generate outline from headings

#### Advanced Text Extraction
- [ ] Preserve text formatting (bold, italic)
- [ ] Extract text with position coordinates
- [ ] Get font information
- [ ] Extract by bounding box

### Low Priority

#### PDF/A Validation
- [ ] Validate PDF/A compliance
- [ ] Convert PDFs to PDF/A format
- [ ] Report compliance issues

#### OCR Integration
- [ ] Integrate OCR for scanned PDFs
- [ ] Detect if PDF needs OCR
- [ ] OCR specific pages or regions
- [ ] Multiple language support

#### Annotations
- [ ] Add text annotations/comments
- [ ] Extract existing annotations
- [ ] Highlight text regions
- [ ] Add stamps and shapes

#### Optimization
- [ ] Compress PDFs (reduce file size)
- [ ] Remove duplicate resources
- [ ] Optimize images
- [ ] Linearize for web viewing

#### Advanced Manipulation
- [ ] Crop pages to specific regions
- [ ] Scale pages (resize)
- [ ] Add headers/footers
- [ ] Insert blank pages

#### Comparison
- [ ] Compare two PDFs for differences
- [ ] Generate diff report
- [ ] Highlight changes visually

## Future Considerations

### Dependencies
- Consider adding `pdfplumber` for enhanced table extraction
- Consider adding `pdf2image` for page-to-image conversion
- Consider adding `pytesseract` for OCR support
- Keep core functions working with PyPDF2 + reportlab only

### Performance Improvements
- Streaming support for large files
- Parallel processing for multi-page operations
- Memory-efficient page processing
- Caching for repeated operations

### API Enhancements
- Batch processing functions
- Progress callbacks for long operations
- Async versions of I/O-heavy functions
- Context managers for resource handling

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests Needed
- [ ] Test all parsing functions with various PDF formats
- [ ] Test creation functions with edge cases
- [ ] Test manipulation functions with different PDFs
- [ ] Test error handling for all functions
- [ ] Test with encrypted PDFs
- [ ] Test with damaged/malformed PDFs
- [ ] Test file size limits
- [ ] Test permission handling

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test complete workflows (read -> modify -> write)
- [ ] Test with real-world PDF documents
- [ ] Test with agent frameworks (Google ADK, LangChain)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks with large files

## Documentation Improvements
- [ ] Add more usage examples
- [ ] Create tutorial for common workflows
- [ ] Document performance characteristics
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Document PDF format limitations

## Version History
- v0.13.0: Initial PDF module implementation (20 functions)
  - Parsing: 7 functions
  - Creation: 6 functions
  - Manipulation: 7 functions
