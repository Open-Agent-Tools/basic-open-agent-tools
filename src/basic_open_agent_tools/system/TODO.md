# System Tools TODO

## Overview
System-level operations and information gathering tools for AI agents.

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Planned for future implementation

## Agent Compatibility Requirements

When implementing this module, all functions MUST follow the agent-friendly design principles established in v0.6.0:
- âœ… **Simple Type Signatures**: Use only basic Python types (str, dict, list, bool, int, float)
- âœ… **No Complex Types**: Avoid Union types, Optional complex types, or custom type aliases
- âœ… **Individual Import Ready**: Functions must work when imported individually
- âœ… **Security First**: All command execution must use safe, validated approaches
- âœ… **Cross-Platform**: Design for Windows, macOS, and Linux compatibility from the start

## Planned Modules

### High Priority
- [ ] **Process Management** (`process.py`)
  - Command execution with timeout
    - Ensure avoidance of shell injection vulnerabilities.
    - Build a mechanism to pre-validate commands for safety.
  - Process spawning and monitoring
    - Separate concerns between command execution and process tree management for modularity.
  - Subprocess communication
  - Process tree operations
    - Add support for platform-specific process management tools as needed.
  - Safe command execution
  - Return code handling

- [ ] **Environment Management** (`environment.py`)
  - Environment variable access
  - PATH manipulation
  - Working directory management
  - User/system information
  - Platform detection
    - Test platform-dependent features early to catch cross-platform issues.
  - Shell detection

- [ ] **System Information** (`info.py`)
  - Operating system details
  - Hardware information (basic)
  - Network interface enumeration
  - Timezone and locale information
  - System uptime and boot time
  - Available system tools detection
  - Start with universally supported features to ensure portability, deferring platform-specific nuances for later consideration.

- [ ] **Logging Integration** (`logging.py`)
  - System log access (where available)
  - Log file monitoring
    - Include features for structured logging (e.g., JSON or CSV formats for AI-readability).
    - Prepare provisions for log file rotation for long-running scenarios.
  - Structured logging helpers
  - Log rotation utilities

## Design Considerations for Agent Tools
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - Identify platform differences early and create abstractions for platform-specific operations.
- Functions designed as individual agent tools
- Secure command execution (avoid shell injection)
- Proper error handling for system operations
- Resource cleanup (processes, file handles)
  - Ensure all long-running operations incorporate timeout mechanisms and clear cleanup procedures.
- Permission and security awareness
- Timeout handling for long-running operations
- Non-blocking operations where possible
- Functions suitable for agent framework integration
- Clear function signatures optimized for AI tool usage

## Suggestions for Organization and Workflow
- Include minimal placeholder files/modules for planned components to align folder structure.
- Create a central shared utility folder (e.g., `utilities/`) for constants, exception handling, configuration, and logging components reusable across modules.
- Begin writing API documentation and examples in the early development phase.
- Ensure cross-platform testing for system-specific modules to minimize regressions later.
- Incrementally deliver components starting from high-priority and widely reusable modules like `process.py` and `environment.py`.
