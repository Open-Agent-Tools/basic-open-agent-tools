# Refactor: Remove data transformation and read-only tools categories

## Summary
This commit removes the data transformation functionality from the data module and eliminates the read-only tools category from the project. The changes streamline the API by focusing on core data processing capabilities and simplifying the tool categorization.

## Changes
- Removed `transform` module and related functions from the data package
- Removed `load_data_transformation_tools()` helper function
- Removed `load_all_read_only_tools()` helper function and the read-only category from `list_all_available_tools()`
- Updated imports and `__all__` lists in affected modules
- Removed test file for read-only tools (`test_read_only_tools.py`)
- Updated `data/README.md` to reflect the removal of data transformation functionality
- Added function signatures documentation to `data/README.md`

## Rationale
The data transformation functionality was removed to simplify the API and reduce overlap with other modules. The read-only tools category was eliminated to streamline tool categorization, as tools are now organized by their functional domain (file_system, text, data) rather than by their operational characteristics (read-only vs. read-write).

## Testing
- Updated tests to reflect the changes in the API
- Added assertion to verify that the "data" category is included in the tools returned by `list_all_available_tools()`
- Removed tests specific to the removed functionality
