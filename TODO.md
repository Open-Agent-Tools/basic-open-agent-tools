# Basic Open Agent Tools - TODO List

## Project Status (v0.9.1)

✅ **Completed Modules (4 core modules):**
- ✅ `file_system/` - File and directory operations
- ✅ `text/` - Text processing tools
- ✅ `data/` - Data manipulation tools
- ✅ `datetime/` - Date and time utilities

✅ **Newly Added Modules (8 advanced modules):**
- ✅ `archive/` - Compression and archive operations
- ✅ `crypto/` - Cryptographic utilities (encoding, hashing, generation)
- ✅ `logging/` - Structured logging and rotation
- ✅ `monitoring/` - Performance monitoring and health checks

- ✅ `pdf/` - PDF creation, manipulation, and reading
- ✅ `system/` - System information and process management
- ✅ `utilities/` - Debugging and timing utilities

## Current Status
- **Functions Available**: 97+ agent tools with Google ADK compatibility
- **Test Coverage**: 74% overall (1154 tests passing, 33 failing)
- **Agent Framework Integration**: Google ADK, LangChain, Strands Agents
- **Quality**: Full ruff compliance, mypy compatibility

## Known Issues to Address
- 33 failing tests in new modules (mostly PDF, monitoring, crypto)
- MyPy type checking has 143 errors in new modules
- Some optional dependencies need documentation updates
- Python version requirement updated to >=3.9

## Future Development Priorities
1. Fix failing tests in new modules
2. Resolve mypy type checking issues
3. Add comprehensive documentation for new modules
4. Improve test coverage for edge cases
5. Consider additional utility modules based on user feedback
