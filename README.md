# basic-open-agent-tools
An open foundational toolkit providing essential components for building AI agents with minimal dependencies for local (non-HTTP/API) actions. Designed to offer core utilities and interfaces that developers can easily integrate into their own agents to avoid excess boilerplate, while being simpler than needs requiring MCP or A2A.
