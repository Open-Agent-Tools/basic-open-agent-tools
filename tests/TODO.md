# Test Coverage TODO

This document outlines gaps in test coverage and areas that need additional testing in the basic-open-agent-tools project.

## Missing Test Files

The following modules or files don't have dedicated test files:

- [ ] **exceptions.py**: Create tests for custom exception classes and their behavior
- [ ] **types.py**: Create tests for type definitions and any helper functions

## Modules with Limited Test Coverage

### File System Module

The current `test_file_system_tools.py` provides only basic coverage. Additional tests needed for:

- [ ] **info.py**: Comprehensive tests for all file information functions
- [ ] **operations.py**: Tests for all file operations beyond basic read/write
- [ ] **tree.py**: More extensive tests for directory tree functionality
- [ ] **validation.py**: Tests for path validation functions

### Data Module

While the data module has good test coverage with dedicated test files for each submodule, consider:

- [ ] **Edge cases**: Add more tests for edge cases and error handling
- [ ] **Integration tests**: Add tests that combine multiple data module functions
- [ ] **Performance tests**: Add tests for performance-critical operations

## Future Modules

As new modules are implemented (from their respective TODO.md files), tests should be created:

- [ ] **crypto module**: Create tests when implementation is added
- [ ] **network module**: Create tests when implementation is added
- [ ] **system module**: Create tests when implementation is added
- [ ] **utilities module**: Create tests when implementation is added

## Test Infrastructure Improvements

Consider the following improvements to the testing infrastructure:

- [ ] **Test coverage reporting**: Add tools to measure and report test coverage
- [ ] **Property-based testing**: Consider adding property-based tests for data transformation functions
- [ ] **Parameterized tests**: Use parameterized tests for functions with multiple similar test cases
