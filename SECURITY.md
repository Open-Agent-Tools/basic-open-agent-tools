## Security Considerations for AI Agent Tools

This toolkit is designed for AI agent frameworks and includes security considerations specific to agent deployments:

### File System Operations
- **Path Validation**: All file operations validate paths to prevent directory traversal attacks
- **Safe Defaults**: Operations default to current working directory when no path specified
- **Input Sanitization**: File content and paths are validated before processing
- **No Arbitrary Execution**: File operations do not execute content as code

### Data Processing
- **Input Validation**: All data processing functions validate input types and formats
- **Size Limits**: Functions include safeguards against processing extremely large data sets
- **Safe Parsing**: JSON, CSV, and other parsers use safe parsing methods
- **No Code Execution**: Data processing does not evaluate or execute user input as code

### Agent Framework Integration
- **Type Safety**: All functions use JSON-serializable types for secure agent integration
- **Parameter Validation**: Function parameters are validated for type and format
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error patterns prevent information leakage
- **No Network Operations**: Core toolkit avoids network operations to prevent SSRF attacks

### Best Practices for Agent Deployments
1. **Validate Input**: Always validate data before passing to toolkit functions
2. **Limit Permissions**: Run agents with minimal necessary file system permissions
3. **Monitor Usage**: Log and monitor agent tool usage in production
4. **Sandbox Environment**: Consider running agents in sandboxed environments
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep the toolkit updated to receive security patches
